this is book 8

So he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down! 
The wolf was greedy and he tried to catch both pigs at 
once, but he was too greedy and got neither! His big 
jaws clamped down on nothing but air and the two little 
pigs scrambled away as fast as their little hooves 
would carry them.
The wolf chased them down the lane and he almost caught 
them. But they made it to the brick house and slammed 
the door closed before the wolf could catch them. The 
three little pigs they were very frightened, they knew 
the wolf wanted to eat them. And that was very, very 
true. The wolf hadn't eaten all day and he had worked 
up a large appetite chasing the pigs around and now he 
could smell all three of them inside and he knew that 
the three little pigs would make a lovely feast.
