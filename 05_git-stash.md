## Stashing

`git stash` is super useful command that helps you save changes that you are not yet ready to commit.  You can stash changes and then come back to them later.

```bash
git stash
```

Running git stash will take all uncommitted changes (staged and unstaged) and stash them, reverting the changes in your working copy.
