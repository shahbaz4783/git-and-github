## Comparison changes with git diff

`git diff` command is used to view changes between commits, branches, files, working directory and more.

```bash
git diff
```

It will list all the changes in our working directory that are not staged for the next commit.


```bash
git diff HEAD
```

It will list all the changes in the working tree since last commit.
