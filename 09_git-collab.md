# Git Workflow for collabration

## Centralised Workflow

The simplest collaborative workflow is to have everyone work on the main branch (or any other SINGLE branch).

### The Problem

While it's nice and easy to only work on the main branch, this leads to some serious issues on teams!

- Lots of time spent resolving conflicts and merging code, especially as team size scales up.

- No one can work on anything without disturbing the main codebase.  How do you try adding something radically different in?  How do you experiment?

- The only way to collaborate on a feature together with another teammate is to push incomplete code to master.  Other teammates now have broken code.
